Both codes have three program options, identified on the arduino by LED1 ON, LED2 ON, LED1 and 2 ON.
in the script _3odors the three programs indicate the usage of the three odor valves (thus the use of three odors)
in the script A_B_AB, the three programs indicate the usage of valve/odor A, of valve/odor B, and of simultaneous usage of valves/odors AB
